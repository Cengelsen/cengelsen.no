# Cengelsen.no

## What is this?

This is my home website. 

## How does this work? 

It uses a custom Hugo theme to build a static site that serves markdown-files. 

## How do I run it locally?

1. Download and install Hugo
2. `git clone https://github.com/Cengelsen/cengelsen.no.git`
3. `git submodule update --init --recursive`
4. `cd cengelsen.no`
5. `hugo serve`

## Feel free to create issues if you see room for improvement :)
