# Cengelsen.no

## What is this?

This is my home website. 

## How does this work? 

It uses a custom Hugo theme to build a static site that serves markdown-files. 

## How do I run it locally?

1. Download and install Hugo
2. ```git clone https://github.com/Cengelsen/cengelsen.no.git```
3. ```cd cengelsen.no```
4. ```hugo serve```
